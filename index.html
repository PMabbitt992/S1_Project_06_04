        Paradise found! This custom-built brand new home sits proudly on a 6.8-acre
        high wooded site overlooking a 300-acre nature conservancy. The setting is
        exceptional, and the home is every bit as exciting! A bright, open layout is
        enhanced by vaulted ceilings, hardwood and tumbled, ceramic flooring, custom
        maple cabinetry, upgraded fixtures, numerous windows, and incredible views.

        There is much more. The property includes a 40x54 storage building - perfect
        for a large boat and machinery. An exposed walkout on lower level leads down to
        a beautiful wooded area.

        An extra bathroom, bedroom, and family room can be added to the unfinished
        basement for more living space.
